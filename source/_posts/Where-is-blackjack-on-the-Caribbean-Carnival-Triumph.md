#  Find blackjack on the Carnival Triumph cruise ship!

The Carnival Triumph cruise ship is a great place to find blackjack games! We found a few different blackjack tables on the ship during our cruise.

The first blackjack table we found was near the casino on deck 5. This table had a $10 minimum bet and a $500 maximum bet. The cards were dealt from a shoe, and the dealer stood on all 17s.

We also found a blackjack table near the pool on deck 12. This table had a $5 minimum bet and a $200 maximum bet. The cards were dealt from a shoe, and the dealer stood on all 17s.

We recommend checking out both of these blackjack tables if you're looking for some gambling fun on your Carnival Triumph cruise!

#  Playing blackjack on the Carnival Triumph cruise ship!

I’ve always wanted to try my hand at blackjack, so when I found out that there was a casino on the Carnival Triumph cruise ship, I knew I had to check it out!

The casino was huge, and it was packed with people playing every game imaginable. But I didn’t let that intimidate me – I went right up to the blackjack table and sat down.

The dealer gave me my cards, and I immediately got excited. This was really happening! I looked at my cards and saw that I had an ace and a two. That meant that if another card came up, I could either go bust (over 21) or get closer to 21.

The dealer flipped over his card, and it was a seven. That meant he had 14 points, so he wasn’t in too bad of shape. But then he drew another card, and it was also a seven! My heart started racing – did this mean I won?

 fortunately, the next card was an eight, which meant the dealer had bust. Phew! That was close!

I cashed in my chips and walked away from the table feeling like a winner. If I could win against the dealer on my first try, then surely I could do even better on future games!

#  How to play blackjack on the Carnival Triumph cruise ship!

If you’re a fan of blackjack and cruising, Carnival Triumph is the ship for you! This massive vessel offers plenty of opportunities to play the popular card game, from the casino to late-night sessions in the main lounges. Here’s how to make the most of your blackjack experience on Carnival Triumph:

1.Head to the casino early in the cruise. The first few days are always the busiest at the casino, so if you want a seat at one of the blackjack tables, get there early.

2.Look for lower minimums during slow times. If you don’t mind playing at tables with lower minimum bets, look for opportunities to do so during slower times onboard. You may be able to find games that let you play for as little as $5 per hand.

3.Focus on basic strategy. If you’re not comfortable making your own decisions while playing blackjack, focus on using basic strategy charts to make the best choices possible. This will help you minimize your losses and give yourself the best chance to win some money during your cruise.

4.Enjoy a few cocktails while playing. Blackjack can be a lot more enjoyable when you’re enjoying a drink or two while playing. Not only does it add to the atmosphere of the casino, but it can also help take the edge off if things start going poorly at the table.
