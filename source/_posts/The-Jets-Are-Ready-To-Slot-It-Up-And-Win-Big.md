#  The Jets Are Ready To Slot It Up And Win Big

The New York Jets are a team on the rise. Heading into their third season under head coach Todd Bowles, the Jets are ready to take the next step and make a serious run at the playoffs.

Wide receiver Quincy Enunwa is confident in the team's chances, telling ESPN that "We're trying to win the Super Bowl. We're not playing to just play games."

The Jets bolstered their offense this offseason, signing running back Isaiah Crowell and quarterback Teddy Bridgewater. They also added cornerback Trumaine Johnson and linebacker Avery Williamson in free agency.

Crowell is coming off a breakout year with the Cleveland Browns, rushing for 853 yards and eight touchdowns. Bridgewater is looking to bounce back from a gruesome knee injury that sidelined him for most of the past two seasons.

Johnson is a three-time Pro Bowler who will provide a veteran presence in the secondary. Williamson was named MVP of the AFC Championship game last year as a member of the Tennessee Titans.

The Jets also have one of the best defensive lines in football, led by Muhammad Wilkerson, Leonard Williams and Sheldon Richardson.

All of that talent could add up to big things for the Jets this season. If they can stay healthy and gel as a team, there's no reason why they can't compete for a playoff spot in the tough AFC East division.

#  It's Time To Slot Machine The Jets!

It's been a long time since the Jets were a serious contender in the National Football League. However, with the additions of quarterback Teddy Bridgewater and running back Le'Veon Bell, as well as some key offseason acquisitions, there is a lot of buzz around the team heading into the 2019-2020 season.

One of the biggest question marks for the Jets is who will be playing slot receiver. The position is up for grabs after Quincy Enunwa was traded to the Buffalo Bills earlier in the offseason. There are many candidates who could fill the role, but one player who could really make an impact is Jamison Crowder.

Crowder was acquired from the Washington Redskins in exchange for wide receiver Derrius Guice. He is coming off of his best season in 2018, in which he recorded 66 receptions for 789 yards and three touchdowns. Crowder has good size (5'8" and 175 lbs) and has proved that he can be a reliable target for quarterbacks.

He also has some playoff experience, having played in two games with Washington during the 2017 season. Crowder would be a great weapon for Bridgewater or Bell to utilize in the slot and could help lead the Jets back to prominence in the NFL.

#  Slotting Into Victory With The Jets!

The Jets are in a good spot as they head into their matchup against the Indianapolis Colts. The Jets have been working on their slot machine offense and it looks like it's starting to pay off.

The main focus of the Jets' offense has been on slot receiver Quincy Enunwa, who has had a great season so far. He has been quarterback Sam Darnold's go-to target, and the two have developed a great rapport.

Enunwa is especially dangerous in the slot, where he can take advantage of defenders who are out of position. He has already racked up 584 yards and four touchdowns this season, and he is sure to cause problems for the Colts' defense.

The Jets will also be able to rely on running back Isaiah Crowell, who has been one of the NFL's most productive backs this season. Crowell is averaging 5.2 yards per carry, and he has already found the end zone seven times this year.

The Colts have had trouble defending the run this season, so Crowell should be able to find plenty of success against them.

The Jets will need to play well in order to beat the Colts, but they certainly have the talent to do so. Enunwa and Crowell will lead the way, and Darnold will continue to develop into one of the NFL's top quarterbacks.
