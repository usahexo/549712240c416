#  Hollywood Comes to Hamburg for Casino Bundesliga Shoot

Casino Bundesliga, the new Hollywood blockbuster movie set to wow audiences around the world, is currently filming in Hamburg. The cast and crew have descended on the city, transforming it into a virtual casino playground.

Hundreds of extras were needed to fill the roles of casino goers, and the call went out for locals to come forward and audition. And whilst many of the roles went to professional actors, some lucky local residents also secured parts in the film.

The film tells the story of six friends who reunite at a Hamburg casino for one wild night of gambling and fun. With its high-energy scenes and thrilling twists and turns, Casino Bundesliga is sure to be a smash hit when it hits screens next year.

In the meantime, locals are enjoying having the stars of Hollywood in their midst. Actors such as Matt Damon and Christian Bale have been spotted out and about in Hamburg, soaking up the sights and sounds of this vibrant city.

#  Behind the Scenes of Casino Bundesliga Shoot in Hamburg

In early September, casino operators were gearing up for the much-anticipated Bundesliga Season 6 in Hamburg. The season is slated to start on September 14th and as part of the promotion, a casino shoot was scheduled. 

The location was an ideal choice given that the city is home to Germany’s first and Europe’s second largest casino. According to reports, the shoot was expected to generate €2 million worth of publicity for the industry and attract new visitors to Hamburg casinos.

Despite initial concerns that the tight schedule might affect operations, both Spielbank Hamburg (the casino organizing the event) and its sister casino, Spielbank Schenefeld came through successfully. 

According to insiders, between 200 and 250 people were employed for the three-day shoot with a further 20 or so hired as extras. Not only did this provide work for local residents but it also allowed for tight security around the set.

Given that casinos are high-value and potentially criminal targets, security is always a paramount concern. In this case, it was even more important as there was money at stake both in terms of publicity and potential profits. 

With over €15 million bet on each match day during last season’s Bundesliga alone, it’s understandable why casino operators would go all out to ensure that things run smoothly behind the scenes. 

From set builders to caterers, everyone had a role to play in making sure that the shoot went off without a hitch. Fortunately, with a little bit of organization and team work, everything went according to plan. 

As fans gear up for another exciting season of Bundesliga action, we can only hope that the cameras will be rolling in some of Germany’s finest casinos.

Casino Bundesliga was shot on location in Hamburg, and many of the city's landmarks can be seen in the movie. The cast and crew have praised Hamburg's picturesque scenery and its lively nightlife.
