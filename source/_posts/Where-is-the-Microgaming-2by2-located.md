#  Where is the Microgaming 2by2 located?

Microgaming is a software development company that creates casino games. One of their products is the 2by2 slot machine. It can be found at various casinos around the world, but there is no specific location that it can be found.

#  Casino location mystery solved!

A recent study by a team of researchers at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas has solved the mystery of why casino resorts are located in certain parts of the city. The study found that casino resorts are more likely to be located in areas with a higher concentration of leisure tourists.

The research team used a Geographic Information System (GIS) to analyze hotel occupancy data for the Las Vegas area from 2009 to 2013. They also looked at demographic information for different parts of the city, including population density, median household income, and percentage of residents who are tourists.

The results of the study showed that casino resorts are more likely to be located in areas with a higher concentration of leisure tourists. In addition, the study found that casino resorts are more likely to be located in areas where the median household income is higher and the percentage of residents who are tourists is higher.

The researchers believe that this information could help city planners decide where to locate future casino resorts.
