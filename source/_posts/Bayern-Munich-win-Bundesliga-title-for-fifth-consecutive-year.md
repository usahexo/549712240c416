#  Bayern Munich win Bundesliga title for fifth consecutive year

In a season that has seen them compete on four different continents, German giants Bayern Munich have added a fifth consecutive Bundesliga title to their trophy cabinet.

The Bavarians sealed the championship with a 7-1 victory over relegated FC Augsburg on Saturday. Goalscorers for Bayern were Robert Lewandowski (2), Kingsley Coman, Serge Gnabry, Leon Goretzka, David Alaba and Joshua Kimmich.

It was an ultimately comfortable triumph for Niko Kovac’s side, who finished two points ahead of Dortmund in the final league table.

Elsewhere, Liverpool ended their 29-year wait for a Premier League title by beating Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-0 on the final day of the season. Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah scored either side of half-time to give Jurgen Klopp’s side the win they needed to pip Manchester City to the title by a single point.

In Spain, Barcelona successfully defended their La Liga crown with a 2-1 victory at Atletico Madrid on Sunday. Lionel Messi and Philippe Coutinho were both on target as Barcelona finished the season one point clear of second-placed Atletico Madrid.

#  Dortmund finish as runners-up; Hoffenheim, Leipzig Secure Champions League spots

Borussia Dortmund's limp finish to the season saw them slip from first to second place, as they could only muster a goalless draw against Werder Bremen on the last day. Hoffenheim and RB Leipzig, meanwhile, secured Champions League berths with 2nd-place finishes and automatic group stage qualifications.

Dortmund knew that only a win would suffice if they were to retain their title, but they were unable to break down a stubborn Bremen defense. This meant that Bayern Munich, who drew 2-2 with 1899 Hoffenheim, were crowned champions for the sixth successive season.

Hoffenheim had started the day in 5th place but leapfrogged Bayer Leverkusen, Schalke 04 and Eintracht Frankfurt with two goals in the final 10 minutes of their game against Bayern. Serge Gnabry set up Sebastian Rudy for the opener in the 82nd minute before Kingsley Coman equalized in the 89th minute. The resulting draw was enough to see Hoffenheim join Leipzig in next season's Champions League.

Leipzig had started their final game of the season 3 points behind Dortmund but knew that a win would see them snatch 2nd place away from their rivals - and that's exactly what they did. A 3-1 victory over Freiburg proved to be enough, as both Dortmund and Hoffenheim failed to win their respective games. Timo Werner opened the scoring for Leipzig in the 5th minute before Nils Petersen equalized shortly after halftime. Emil Forsberg put Leipzig back in front before Yussuf Poulsen sealed all three points in stoppage time.

This is Hoffenheim's first ever qualification for the Champions League, while it's RB Leipzig's second consecutive appearance in Europe's top club competition. As for Bayern Munich, they will once again compete in the Champions League group stage as defending champions - although they may have wished for a harder draw this time around.

#  Schalke 04 and Bayer Leverkusen relegated to Bundesliga 2

After a long and arduous season, the final Bundesliga relegation spots have finally been decided. Schalke 04 and Bayer Leverkusen will be playing in the second division of German football next year, while Hamburger SV and Wolfsburg managed to maintain their top-flight status.

Schalke had been in danger of relegation for quite some time, but their poor form in the latter stages of the season sealed their fate. They ended up winning just two of their last thirteen games, which was not enough to keep them up. As for Bayer Leverkusen, they were always fighting an uphill battle after a dreadful start to the season. They barely scraped together enough points to avoid the drop until the very last game of the season.

Hamburger SV and Wolfsburg both had to win their final matches in order to stay up, and they both did so convincingly. HSV beat relegation rivals Mainz 05 3-0, while Wolfsburg thrashed relegated Cologne 5-1. This means that Hamburg will be playing in the Bundesliga for yet another season, while Wolfsburg will be hoping to improve on their lowly fifteenth place finish.

#  Borussia Monchengladbach and Eintracht Frankfurt secure Europa League places

Borussia Monchengladbach and Eintracht Frankfurt have secured Europa League places for the 2018/19 season.

Gladbach sealed their spot with a goalless draw against Hoffenheim, while Frankfurt beat Nurnberg 2-1.

Frankfurt’s victory means they finish in sixth place, while Gladbach finish in seventh.

Both clubs will now compete in Europe’s second tier competition next season.

#  Werder Bremen, VfL Wolfsburg and Hannover 96 relegated to 2. Bundesliga

Werder Bremen, VfL Wolfsburg and Hannover 96 were relegated to the 2. Bundesliga after finishing the 2017-2018 Bundesliga season in the bottom three places. This marks the first time in the history of the Bundesliga that three teams have been relegated in the same season.

All three clubs had high hopes for a successful season but ultimately fell short. Werder Bremen endured an especially difficult season, with their manager Alexander Nouri getting fired in November and a coaching change not helping them improve results.

In contrast, VfL Wolfsburg had high hopes of qualifying for European competition but never really got going and Hannover 96 were also inconsistent throughout the year. The relegation of these three clubs means that there will be some major changes ahead in the 2. Bundesliga next season.
