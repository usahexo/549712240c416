#  What to do When the Gambler You Love Starts Winning

If you're the partner or loved one of someone who gambles, it can be pretty confusing and frustrating when they start winning. On the one hand, it's amazing to see your loved one achieve something great; on the other hand, their gambling could quickly spiral out of control again. So what should you do when the gambler you love starts winning?

First, try to stay positive and supportive. congratulate your loved one on their success, and let them know that you're proud of them. However, make sure you also continue to express any concerns or fears you have about their gambling behavior. This balance of support and concern is crucial to helping your loved one stay on track.

Second, try to keep tabs on how much money they're winning and losing. While it's important to celebrate your loved one's wins, it's also important to be aware of how much money they're spending - especially if they've been struggling with gambling addiction in the past. If your loved one is starting to gamble more aggressively or recklessly in order to chase their wins, then it's time to step in and intervene.

Finally, talk to your loved one about their gambling behavior. Find out why they're suddenly winning, and ask them how they plan to handle their new-found wealth. It's important that they understand that gambling should never be seen as a way to make easy money; any wins are purely coincidental and should not be relied upon for financial security. Help your loved one come up with a solid plan for managing their finances responsibly, so that they don't fall back into bad habits if/when they start losing again.
