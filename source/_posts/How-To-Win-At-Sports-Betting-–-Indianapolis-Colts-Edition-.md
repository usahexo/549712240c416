#  How To Win At Sports Betting – Indianapolis Colts Edition 

The Indianapolis Colts have a long and storied history in the National Football League. The team was founded in 1953 as the Baltimore Colts and moved to Indianapolis in 1984. The Colts have won three Super Bowls (2006, 2009, and 2010), two AFC Championships (2003 and 2004), and one AFL Championship (1958).

The Colts are a popular team to bet on, but how can you make sure that you win your bets? In this article, we will give you some tips on how to win when betting on the Indianapolis Colts.

First and foremost, it is important to do your research before placing any bets. Make sure to look at the team’s history, as well as their current form. Also, take a look at the odds for each game and try to find good value bets.

Secondly, always make sure to gamble responsibly. Don’t bet more than you can afford to lose, and never gamble if you are feeling stressed or anxious. Gambling should be fun, so make sure to only bet what you can afford to lose.

Finally, practice patience and discipline. Don’t go betting on every game; choose wisely which games you think offer good value bets. And don’t be tempted to chase your losses – if you lose money one week, don’t try to make it all back by betting on a game that you know is a long shot. Be patient and let your wins build over time.

#  6 Methods To Extract Money From Sports Betting On Indianapolis Colts Games 

There are many ways to make money from sports betting on Indianapolis Colts games. Some methods are more risky than others, but they can all be profitable if done correctly. Here are six methods to extract money from sports betting on Colts games.

1) Bet the Spread - The most basic and common way to make money from sports betting is to bet the spread. When you bet the spread, you are betting that the team you select will win or lose by a certain number of points. For example, if you think the Colts will beat the Houston Texans by a touchdown, you would bet thespread and select the Colts (-7). If they won by exactly seven points, you would win your bet.

2) Bet Totals - Another popular way to make money from sports betting is to bet totals. When you bet totals, you are betting on how many points will be scored in the game by both teams combined. For example, if you think there will be a lot of scoring in Sunday's matchup between the Colts and Texans, you may want to bet the total over/under at 54 points. If 54 or more points are scored in the game, you would win your bet.

3) Bet on Which Team Will Win - You can also make money by betting on which team will win the game outright. This can be a bit riskier than betting against the spread or totals, but it can also be more lucrative if done correctly.

4) Play Parlays - Parlays are a great way to increase your potential profits while also taking on less risk. A parlay is when you combine two or more bets into one and increase your payout if all of your selections are correct. For example, if you bet $10 on three different games and all three of your selections cover the spread, then you would win $680 (your initial $10 investment plus a $670 payout).

5) Use Point Spreads as an Indicator - In some cases, it may be smarter not to actually bet on the game itself, but rather use the point spreads as an indicator for other bets. For example, let's say that you think that Andrew Luck and company will blow out Houston this weekend, but don't want to risk your money on such a large margin of victory. You could instead place a smaller wager on another game this weekend and use the point spread for Indianapolis-Houston as an indicator for how that game might play out. If Indy does cover by a large margin, then it's likely that the other game was also heavily skewed in their direction.

6) Hedge Your Bets - Finally, one of the smartest ways to make money from sports betting is to hedge your bets. This means that instead of putting all of your eggs into one basket, you split your bets up between multiple outcomes. For example, let's say that you think Indianapolis is going to beat Houston by 8 points this weekend. Instead of just betting on Indy to win outright,you could also place a smaller wager on them winning by 9+ points or <7 points so that no matter what happens,you have something to show for it.

#  Expert Tips For Sports Betting On The Indianapolis Colts 

The Indianapolis Colts are a professional American football team based in Indianapolis, Indiana. They are members of the South Division of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the National Football League (NFL).

The Colts have played their home games at Lucas Oil Stadium since 2008. The Colts were founded as the Baltimore Colts in 1953. After 31 seasons in Baltimore, including an NFL championship in 1958, they moved to Indianapolis.

The Colts played in Baltimore from 1953 to 1983. In 1984, they moved to Indianapolis, where they have played ever since. The Colts have had mixed results since arriving in Indianapolis. They made the playoffs eleven times between 1984 and 2007, but only won two playoff games. Their two Super Bowl appearances (both losses) came during this time period. In 2009, the team finished with a 2-14 record, which was the worst record in the NFL that year and resulted in them being awarded the first overall pick in the 2010 NFL Draft.

The team has improved markedly since then, reaching 10 wins four times between 2012 and 2018; including consecutive 8-win seasons from 2015 to 2017 – a first for the franchise since their days in Baltimore. In December 2011, owner Jim Irsay announced that Peyton Manning would not return to play for the team after his contract expired at the end of the season due to his multiple neck surgeries.

For fans of NFL betting, there is no question that placing wagers on games featuring the Indianapolis Colts is both exciting and potentially profitable. However, if you’ve never wagered on pro football before or just want to make sure your betting game is up to par, then heed these expert tips for sports betting on the Indianapolis Colts:

1) Know your stuff . It might seem like common sense, but if you don’t know anything about either football or betting odds then it’s best not to place any bets on NFL games - let alone games involving the Indianapolis Colts. So do your homework! Study up on both teams involved as well as past matchups and recent performance trends; not only will this help you make informed predictions, but it will also give you a better understanding of how betting odds work so you can spot value when making your picks. 

     ) Innings bet rather than sides . When wagering on NFL games - especially ones featuring teams like the Indianapolis Colts - it’s usually a good idea to bet on individual quarters or halves rather than picking sides (e.g., Team A to win outright). This is because even if you think one team is likely to win outright, there’s always a chance they could falter late in the game and lose anyway; by betting on specific innings/halves you reduce this risk somewhat while still giving yourself a chance at profits if things go your way . 

3) Use multiple reputable sportsbooks . Not all sportsbooks are created equal when it comes to NFL betting; some offer better odds and bonuses than others, so it’s always worth checking out several different sites before making your final picks. Just be careful not to get caught up in gimmicks or too-good-to-be-true odds - remember, if something sounds too good to be true then it probably is! Stick with well-known and reputable sportsbooks whenever possible to avoid any nasty surprises further down the line .
