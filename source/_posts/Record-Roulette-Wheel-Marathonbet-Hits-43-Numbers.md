Record Roulette Wheel Marathonbet Hits 43 Numbers

A marathonbet roulette wheel marathon has seen 43 different numbers hit, with the possibility of the number 44 hitting at any time. This is a new record for the online casino, which is offering a range of special bets to take advantage of this unique event.

The marathon began on July 10th and will continue until a winner hits 44 numbers. The odds of this happening are currently estimated at 1 in 9 million, but as more players take part, these odds are likely to change.

In order to qualify for the marathon, players must bet at least €10 on any combination of red or black, odd or even, or high or low numbers. Once they have placed their bet, they can then choose to add on additional bets on individual numbers. These bets must be placed before the results of the previous spin are known.

If one of the players hits 44 numbers, they will win a prize worth €1 million. This is more than twice the amount that would be won if they had hit 42 numbers. In addition, anyone who hits 43 numbers will win a prize worth €100,000.

There is no limit to how many times players can bet on each spin, so those who are feeling lucky could potentially keep placing bets until they hit 44 numbers. However, it’s important to note that losses cannot be refunded if the wrong bet is placed. Players should also bear in mind that other games such as slots and blackjack are not included in this promotion.

This marathon offers an excellent opportunity for players to boost their bankrolls significantly and there’s plenty of time left to take part. So why not head over to Marathonbet and see if you can become a millionaire?
