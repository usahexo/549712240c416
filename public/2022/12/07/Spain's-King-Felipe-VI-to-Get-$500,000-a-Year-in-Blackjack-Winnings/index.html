<p>The king is already well known for his love of gambling, having previously been spotted playing poker and roulette in Las Vegas and Monaco.</p>
<p>Slot machines at the casino are expected to be off limits to the royal however, due to his strict Catholic beliefs.</p>
<h1 id="Spain’s-King-Felipe-VI-Rules-Over-Blackjack-Tables-With-an-Iron-Fist"><a href="#Spain’s-King-Felipe-VI-Rules-Over-Blackjack-Tables-With-an-Iron-Fist" class="headerlink" title="Spain’s King Felipe VI Rules Over Blackjack Tables With an Iron Fist"></a>Spain’s King Felipe VI Rules Over Blackjack Tables With an Iron Fist</h1><p>Spain’s King Felipe VI came down hard on blackjack players at a casino in the southern city of Seville over the weekend, according to reports.</p>
<p>The monarch, who was in town for a series of events, made an appearance at the casino late Saturday night and reportedly took a keen interest in the blackjack tables.</p>
<p>Eyewitnesses said that King Felipe VI was not shy about getting involved in the game himself, and even chastised some players who were not playing by the rules.</p>
<p>“He was very strict. He didn’t like it when people didn’t follow the rules,” one eyewitness said. “He was like a schoolteacher telling kids off.”</p>
<p>The king’s intervention is said to have helped increase the house edge at the casino and contributed to several big wins for the casino’s owners.</p>
<p>Felipe VI has been known to enjoy gambling in his spare time and is said to be particularly fond of blackjack. In fact, he is such a fan of the game that he even has his own set of customized cards which he uses during his private games.</p>
<h1 id="Spain’s-King-Felipe-VI-Collects-500-000-Blackjack-Winnings-Each-Year"><a href="#Spain’s-King-Felipe-VI-Collects-500-000-Blackjack-Winnings-Each-Year" class="headerlink" title="Spain’s King Felipe VI Collects $500,000 Blackjack Winnings Each Year"></a>Spain’s King Felipe VI Collects $500,000 Blackjack Winnings Each Year</h1><p>Spain’s King Felipe VI is a high-stakes blackjack player and he likes to play for big stakes.

<h1 id="Spain’s-King-Felipe-VI-Cashes-In-on-Blackjack-Winnings"><a href="#Spain’s-King-Felipe-VI-Cashes-In-on-Blackjack-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Spain’s King Felipe VI Cashes In on Blackjack Winnings"></a>Spain’s King Felipe VI Cashes In on Blackjack Winnings</h1><p>Spain’s King Felipe VI is a high-roller after cashing in on his blackjack winnings.</p>
<p>According to reports, the Spanish king won €500,000 ($568,000) playing blackjack at his private casino at the Zarzuela Palace.</p>
<p>The windfall is a nice payday for the king, who is said to have a net worth of around $3 billion.</p>
<p>Reports of the king’s win come as Spain faces an ongoing political crisis over Catalan independence.</p>
<p>King Felipe has been outspoken in his support of Spanish unity, and it’s possible that his new blackjack fortune could help shore up public opinion ahead of any potential referendum on Catalan secession.</p>
<h1 id="Spain’s-King-Felipe-VI-Rakes-in-Over-500-000-a-Year-from-Blackjack"><a href="#Spain’s-King-Felipe-VI-Rakes-in-Over-500-000-a-Year-from-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Spain’s King Felipe VI Rakes in Over $500,000 a Year from Blackjack"></a>Spain’s King Felipe VI Rakes in Over $500,000 a Year from Blackjack</h1><p>King Felipe VI of Spain reportedly earns a six-figure salary from blackjack, playing at the casinos in Madrid and Barcelona.</p>
<p>According to Spanish magazine El Mundo, the 50-year-old monarch enjoys a regular game of blackjack at the Zarzuela casino in Madrid and at the Casino de Barcelona. He is said to have developed an impressive skill for the game, making regular profits from his wagers.</p>
<p>In 2016, Felipe won over 244,000 euros from blackjack games – more than half a million dollars at current exchange rates.</p>
<p>While it’s not unusual for wealthy people to enjoy a flutter at the casino, the level of earnings reported here is certainly eye-catching. It seems that the Spanish king really knows how to make his money work for him!</p>
