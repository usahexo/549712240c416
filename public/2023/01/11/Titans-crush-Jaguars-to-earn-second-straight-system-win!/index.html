The team looked to continue their momentum against a tough Jacksonville squad.</p>
<p>The Jaguars came into the game as a 5 point underdog, but they were not going to go down without a fight. The Titans started off strong, scoring on their opening drive and taking a 7-0 lead. The Jaguars would respond with a touchdown of their own to tie the game at 7.</p>
<p>The Titans would take control of the game in the second half, scoring touchdowns on 3 of their 4 drives to take a commanding 35-14 lead. The Jaguars would add a late touchdown, but it was too little too late as the Titans easily won 35-21.</p>
<p>It was another impressive win for the Titans, who are looking like one of the top teams in the NFL early in the season. They will look to carry this momentum into next week’s matchup against the Texans.</p>
<h1 id="Titans-use-balanced-attack-to-secure-another-system-victory"><a href="#Titans-use-balanced-attack-to-secure-another-system-victory" class="headerlink" title="Titans use balanced attack to secure another system victory!"></a>Titans use balanced attack to secure another system victory!</h1><p>In a hard fought match that went down to the wire, the Titans used a well balanced attack to defeat the visiting Bears system. The Bears had come into the game with an impressive record, but the Titans proved too much for them.</p>
<p>Led by QB Marcus Mariota and HB Derrick Henry, the Titans offense was able to keep the Bears defense off balance all game. Mariota completed 17 of 26 passes for 213 yards and 2 touchdowns, while Henry carried the ball 25 times for 143 yards and 2 touchdowns.</p>
<p>The Bears were able to score early in the game, taking a 7-0 lead. But the Titans answered back with a touchdown drive of their own, and then took the lead early in the second quarter. The Bears would tie it up before halftime, but after that it was all Titans.</p>
<p>Mariota led two more touchdown drives in the second half, and the Titans defense was able to hold off a late rally by the Bears. In the end, it was a 34-27 victory for Tennessee.</p>
<p>This was an important win for the Titans, who now have an 8-5 record and are in strong contention for a playoff spot. They will next take on the Jaguars on Christmas Eve.</p>
<h1 id="Titans-run-rampant-against-lowly-Jaguars-for-easy-system-win"><a href="#Titans-run-rampant-against-lowly-Jaguars-for-easy-system-win" class="headerlink" title="Titans run rampant against lowly Jaguars for easy system win!"></a>Titans run rampant against lowly Jaguars for easy system win!</h1><p>The Tennessee Titans made quick and easy work of the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday, running rampant on both sides of the ball en route to a 37-16 victory. The win moves the Titans to 3-1 on the season and reinforces their status as one of the NFL’s top teams.</p>
<p>Quarterback Marcus Mariota had another strong performance, completing 15 of his 25 passes for 209 yards and two touchdowns. Tight end Delanie Walker was his favorite target, hauling in six catches for 74 yards and a touchdown. The Titans’ rushing attack was also dominant, led by Derrick Henry’s 92 yards on 19 carries.</p>
<p>The Jaguars (3-2) were never in this game, falling behind 14-0 in the first quarter and never getting closer than eight points thereafter. Leonard Fournette was held to just 33 yards on 14 carries, while Blake Bortles completed 22 of his 34 passes for 245 yards and two touchdowns but also threw two costly interceptions.</p>
<p>The Titans now head into their bye week with high expectations and plenty of momentum heading into the second half of the season. They will face a tough test in Week 8 when they travel to face the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p>
<h1 id="Titans-dominate-offensively-in-comfortable-system-win-over-Jacksonville"><a href="#Titans-dominate-offensively-in-comfortable-system-win-over-Jacksonville" class="headerlink" title="Titans dominate offensively in comfortable system win over Jacksonville!"></a>Titans dominate offensively in comfortable system win over Jacksonville!</h1><p>In their first game of the season, the Tennessee Titans were dominant offensively, winning 37-16 against divisional rivals Jacksonville. Mariota completed over 80% of his passes and had 4 touchdowns on the day.</p>
<p>The Titans operated comfortably in their new offensive system, which is based around getting the ball out quickly to their playmakers. This was a clear departure from their old scheme, which was much more reliant on Mariota holding onto the ball for longer to make plays downfield.</p>
<p>This change in approach is a result of new Head Coach Mike Vrabel and Offensive Coordinator Matt LaFleur, who both joined the team this offseason. LaFleur comes from the Sean McVay coaching tree, and has a track record of developing young quarterbacks. It is clear that he is already having a positive impact on Mariota’s game.</p>
<p>The Titans also looked impressive on defense, sacking Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles 5 times. This was a big improvement on last year, when they only managed to sack opposing quarterbacks 26 times all season.</p>
<p>Overall, it was an impressive performance from the Titans, and they will be looking to build on it in next week’s match-up against the Texans.</p>
<h1 id="Titans-roll-past-Jaguars-for-their-second-consecutive-system-victory"><a href="#Titans-roll-past-Jaguars-for-their-second-consecutive-system-victory" class="headerlink" title="Titans roll past Jaguars for their second consecutive system victory!"></a>Titans roll past Jaguars for their second consecutive system victory!</h1><p>The Tennessee Titans rolled past the Jacksonville Jaguars for their second consecutive victory. The Titans offence looked solid as they scored on each of their first three possessions. Marcus Mariota threw two touchdown passes and Derrick Henry ran for a touchdown. The defence was also impressive, holding the Jaguars to just three points.</p>
<p>This was a big win for the Titans, who are now 2-1 and in first place in the AFC South. They will look to keep the momentum going next week against the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>
